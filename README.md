# Julia-Set
The Julia Set program allows users to interactively adjust various parameters and generate customized Julia Set fractals. The program provides a user interface with sliders to control the A and B variables, which influence the shape and structure of the Julia Set. Additionally, the program allows users to modify the maximum iterations, hue, saturation, brightness, and zoom level to further customize the fractal visualization.

The program offers three different equation types to choose from: Circular, Quadratic, and Cubic. Each equation type results in a unique Julia Set with distinct patterns and characteristics.

As users adjust the parameters and equation type, the program dynamically updates the Julia Set to reflect the changes in real-time. This enables users to experiment and observe the effects of different configurations on the fractal rendering.
